## Overview

This is a system designed to review the promotional sales during the month. It is designed to be manager review only and will require a password to be put in correctly in order to activate the system.

This will then return values to the terminal to show key information for the management team to evaluate performance;
- It will start with the stock section, providing useful insites into the items that have been sold.
- It will then move onto the advisor review section and shows key information regarding performances.


## User Stories

The first time you run this code should be at the end of the first day; this will then run the code and complete the first update for the system.

The second and all further runs of the programme will display the same information but will show the managers up to date information regarding performance.

There will be some updates to the spreadsheets that will then allow further analysis to be displayed to the manager
